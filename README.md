# Demographics
The Planning and Development Department uses information from the U.S. Census Bureau along with other agencies to develop demographic data and estimates for the City as well as City Council Districts and City Super Neighborhoods. Demographic data includes, but is not limited to: population, housing, household, income and other social characteristics. My duties included updating tables and creating maps and documents using the data.
